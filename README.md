# Multi-User-Dungeon <br>
Final project for cs2600 by Timothy Christian, Ricky Villanueva, Christopher Mendoza, Nicholas Barkero<br><br>

This project is a modular, multi-user dungeon game where the gameplay changes each time you traverse through a connector. It not only randomizes the next map upon entering a connector room but also “remembers” your navigation history so you can backtrack exactly to where you came from. Each and every map is unique with their own separate themes with various descriptions.<br><br>

The game is on a ESP32 kit that uses a joystick and LCD to play the game.<br><br>

To play the game, you have to use a joystick to move around the rooms. The setup is based on Freenova's Chapter 14 and Chapter 20. To move around, you use the joystick and for the directions you can move North, West, East, and South. The LCD display will show what direction you are going and display the room's descriptions.<br><br>

Debugging-wise: You can use the terminal to navigate through the rooms and check every map and rooms.
